# Lewis-Studio-Design
An aesthetically pleasing Landing page for a creative Studio, this is part of a series of sites to be built in the coming months.
Use of Javascript Animations API

Use of Intersection Observer API
Deeper Understanding of z-index and Stacking Contexts

Observations made on how to build projects Faster
* use of Custom Utility classes
*use of CSS variables for repeated properties
*Green Sock Animation seems to be a more robust Option as creating animations with the web animations api was a bit complex

Responsiveness
*Font, Spacing and Typography chained to the Default font size makes
it almost fully Responsive by default
*Grids was extremely useful for both layout and Flexibility
*Apparently intrinsic web dESign where the content and Spacing determines the 
Size of container elements is best rather than giving fixed widths and 
heights
